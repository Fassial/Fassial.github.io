# About
Currently, I am an undergraduate student majoring in computer science from Hongyi Honor College, [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/). 

I was a research intern at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), working on Computer Network with Wenquan Xu and [Bin Liu](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/cs/4616/2013/20130424093153561198286/20130424093153561198286_.html).Now, I am a research intern at [NIBS](http://nibs.ac.cn/), working on Neuroscience with Ruiyu Wang and [Minmin Luo](http://nibs.ac.cn/yjsjyimgshow.php?cid=5&sid=6&id=775).

I will be a Ph.D. student in the [AAIS](http://www.aais.pku.edu.cn) department at Peking University.

My research interests lie on computational neuroscience and brain-inspired computing.
